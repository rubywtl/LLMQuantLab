# QuantEval

This codebase compares four quantization methods—ATOM, QServe, QuaRot, and SpinQuant—by evaluating their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and memory usage. Each method is implemented for easy benchmarking across machine learning models, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
